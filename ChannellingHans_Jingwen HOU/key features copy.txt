When the user first opens the page they are presented with a bubble plot representing the countries of the world. The bubble area is mapped to population of the country and scaled. The countries are described by GDP and Global Competitiveness Index on the x- and y-axis respectively. The x-axis (GDP) is scaled using a log scale in order to be able to view all countries on the graph.
The bubbles are coloured according to their region with the legend of the colours displayed at the top of page.The visualisation first displays the data for 2007. The Play All button at the top of the page allows the user to animate the change in country statistics between 2007-2017. The animation will run until the user presses the stop button. And users can press any year button to view data for a particular year.
Presse the "show trace" button to select a country and view its trace.
We chose to use a grouped barchart for the second visualisation as bar charts are simple to understand and we felt that their visual structure matched the structure of the data.  As there were no parts of a whole relationship in the data, we decided that a grouped barchart was more appropriate than a stacked bar chart. In this case, there was a need to provide a multivariate visualisation. Grouped barcharts are useful for this as they allow comparison of the pillars of global competitiveness for one country as well as comparison of the pillars between two countries.
